# maze-solver-line-follower-
an autonomous robot that can solve a maze by following lines.

this maze solver is a bit unusual because its only using 3 IR sensors, whiche make it a more challenging task , maze solving conditions 
are different know but the principle is the same  (left hand methode) that consist on going :
1-left if there is a left turn. 

2-forward if there is no left turn. 

3-right if there is no left turn or forward possibility.

4-and make a U turn if there is a dead end. 

it also includes the line followers principle of adjusting the direction to follow the line.

the circuit provided has only 2 IR sensors,the third can be added the sam way.



further work:
it is possible to add some AI into this project making solve the maze directly without any wrong turns at the seconde launch,
using some specifique learning methodes like Q learning.
